# BigInt
this code can be compiled by `make` command.
`make` and `make clean` command is supported.
By the way, this code is written in C++ language and on the basis of 'RedHat' of 'Cent' OS.
Attention! This class override most of operators like '+' and so on. Module operator is always used when the two numbers are positive, but code will ignore the minus sign and compute the answer as the two are both positive if one of them is negative.
It is my honor if this code can give you any favor.
Please contact me if there is any error.
In the end, Thanks all.
